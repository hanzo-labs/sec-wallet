shares, but will use reasonable efforts to sell the shares. The Fund is not required to raise a minimum amount of proceeds from
this offering to commence operations. Assets that cannot be invested as described in the section of this prospectus entitled “Investment
Objective, Policies and Strategies—Investment Strategy,” will be invested in cash or cash equivalents including money
market instruments, commercial paper, bank certificates of deposit, banker’s acceptances, and repurchase agreements collateralized
by U.S. Government Securities. The Fund’s continuous offering is expected to continue in reliance on Rule 415 under the Securities
Act of 1933 until the date the Fund has sold [1,000,000] shares, or such shorter date as the Board may determine.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">The Fund will issue its shares as digital securities (“Hanzo
UST Coins” or “shares”), meaning the securities will be uncertificated registered securities, the ownership and
transfer of which will be authenticated and recorded on one or more distributed ledgers. The validity of all available copies of
such distributed ledgers can be mathematically proven utilizing cryptographically-secured distributed ledger technology, also known
as blockchain technology. See “About the Digital Securities.”</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">Hanzo UST Coins are intended to function
as stablecoins, which are a type of asset-backed digital asset. In general, the value of a stablecoin is pegged to the value of
a reference asset such as U.S. dollars, other fiat currencies, gold, or other assets with relatively stable values. In the case
of Hanzo UST Coins, the reference asset is the Fund’s portfolio which, under normal circumstances, will be composed primarily
of U.S. Government Securities.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">The Fund has implemented a share repurchase program, but it
is only required to repurchase between 5% and 25% of its outstanding shares per quarter. The Fund intends to begin repurchasing
Hanzo UST Coins at the end of the second full quarter following the effectiveness of the Registration Statement. If an active secondary
market in Hanzo UST Coins develops, shareholders should keep in mind that Hanzo UST Coins are not directly tethered to the Fund’s
NAV, which is only calculated once per day, generally at the close of business of the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”)
(see “Determination of Net Asset Value”). Shares of closed-end funds, like the Fund, frequently trade at a discount
from their NAV or may trade at a premium to NAV. If the shares trade at a discount to NAV, it may increase the risk of loss for
investors in this offering.</p>

<p style="font: italic 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; background-color: white">This summary does not contain
all of the information that you should consider before investing in the shares. You should review the more detailed information

<p style="font: bold 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">The Fund</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Hanzo U.S. Treasury Fund (the “Fund”) is a continuously
offered, nondiversified, closed-end management investment company that intends to operate as an interval fund. As an interval fund,
the Fund will offer to make repurchases of between 5% and 25% of its outstanding shares at net asset value (“NAV”),
on a quarterly basis, unless such offer is suspended or postponed in accordance with regulatory requirements. See “Quarterly
Repurchases of Shares.”</p>

<p style="font: bold 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Investment Objective and Strategies</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><b><i>Investment Objective. </i></b>The Fund’s investment
objective is to seek maximum total return consistent with preservation of capital. There can be no assurance that the Fund will
achieve this objective. See “The Fund’s Investments” and “Risks.” The Fund’s investment objective
is non-fundamental and may be changed by the Board of Trustees (the “Board”) without shareholder approval. Shareholders
will, however, receive at least 60 days’ prior notice of any change in this investment objective.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><b><i>Principal Investment Strategies. </i></b>The Fund pursues
its investment objective by investing, under normal circumstances, at least 80% of its assets in fixed income securities that are
issued or guaranteed by the U.S. Government, its agencies or government-sponsored enterprises (“U.S. Government Securities”).
Assets not invested in U.S. Government Securities may be invested in other types of fixed income instruments including bonds, debt
securities and other similar instruments issued by various U.S. and non-U.S. public- or private-sector entities (“Fixed-Income
Securities”). Under normal circumstances, the Fund will have maximum average portfolio duration of eight years and a dollar-weighted
average portfolio maturity of between zero and eight years.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">The Fund may invest in a variety of Fixed-Income Securities,
as discussed in more detail below. The Fund’s investments in Fixed-Income Securities are limited to investment grade securities
of issuers that are rated at least A by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. (“Moody’s”), or equivalently rated
by Standard &amp; Poor’s Ratings Services (“S&amp;P”) or Fitch, Inc. (“Fitch”), or, if unrated, that
are determined by the Adviser to be of comparable quality. The Fund may only invest up to 10% of its total assets in securities
rated A by Moody’s, or equivalently rated by S&amp;P or Fitch, or, if unrated, that are determined by the Adviser to be of
comparable quality.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">The “total return” sought by the Fund consists of
income earned on the Fund’s investments, plus capital appreciation, if any, which generally arises from decreases in interest
rates or improving credit fundamentals for a particular sector or security.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">For more information on the Fund’s investment strategies,

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">The Fund intends to engage in a continuous offering of its
shares at NAV per share. The Fund is authorized as a Delaware statutory trust to issue an unlimited number of shares. The
Fund is offering to sell, under the terms of this prospectus, up to [1,000,000] shares of beneficial interest at NAV per
share. The initial NAV per share is $[1.00]. The minimum initial investment by a shareholder is $1,000. Subsequent investments
may be made with at least $100. The Fund is not required to raise a minimum amount of proceeds from this offering to commence
operations. Assets that cannot be invested as described in the section of this prospectus entitled “Investment
Objective, Policies and Strategies—Investment Strategy,” will be invested in cash or cash equivalents. The
Fund’s continuous offering is expected to continue in reliance on Rule 415 under the Securities Act of 1933 until the
date the Fund has sold [1,000,000] shares, or such shorter date as the Board may determine.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"></p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">The Fund will issue its shares as digital securities (“Hanzo
UST Coins” or “shares”), meaning the securities will be uncertificated registered securities, the ownership
and transfer of which will be authenticated and recorded on one or more distributed ledgers. The validity of all available copies
of such distributed ledgers can be mathematically proven utilizing cryptographically-secured distributed ledger technology, also
known as blockchain technology. See “About the Digital Securities.”&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Hanzo UST Coins are intended to function as stablecoins, which
are a type of asset-backed digital asset. In general, the value of a stablecoin is pegged to the value of a reference asset such
as U.S. dollars, other fiat currencies, gold, or other assets with relatively stable values. In the case of Hanzo UST Coins, the
reference asset is the Fund’s portfolio which, under normal circumstances, will be composed primarily of U.S. Government
Securities. The goal of stablecoins is to maintain a stable value vis-à-vis the underlying reference asset, which itself
is generally known for having a stable value. There is no guarantee that the Fund or Hanzo UST Coins will be able to maintain a
stable value.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Notwithstanding the continuous nature of this offering, the
Fund may close at any time to new investors at the discretion of the Adviser. During such closings, only purchases of the Fund’s
shares by existing shareholders of the Fund or the reinvestment of dividends by such existing shareholders, as applicable, will
be permitted. The Fund may re-open to new investments and subsequently close again to new investors at any time at the discretion
of the Adviser. Any such opening and closing of the Fund will be disclosed to investors through a supplement to this prospectus.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Hanzo Investment Management, LLC (“Hanzo” or the “Adviser”),
a Delaware limited liability company, is responsible for investing the Fund’s portfolio. Hanzo is wholly-owned by Praesidium
Partners, Inc., a privately held holding company, and is registered with the SEC as an investment adviser under the Investment
Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the “Advisers Act”). The Fund’s portfolio manager is Jeffrey M. Dorman. Mr.
Dorman has managed the Fund since its inception. As of [•], 2018, Hanzo had approximately $[•] in assets under management.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Pursuant to an investment advisory agreement with the Fund (the
“Investment Advisory Agreement”), Hanzo will be entitled to receive a management fee, calculated at the annual rate
of [•]% of the Fund’s average annual net assets. The management fee will be calculated and accrued daily and payable
monthly in arrears.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Hanzo will also be eligible to earn a performance fee calculated
at the annual rate of [•]% of the interest income (excluding capital gains) earned on the Fund’s portfolio holdings.
The performance fee will be calculated and accrued daily and payable quarterly in arrears.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">The Adviser and the Fund have entered into an expense limitation
and reimbursement agreement (the “Expense Limitation Agreement”) under which the Adviser has agreed contractually to
waive its fees and to pay, absorb or reimburse the ordinary operating expenses of the Fund (including organizational and offering
expenses, but excluding: (i) the performance fee earned on the Fund’s interest income; (ii) distribution and shareholder
servicing fees, interest, taxes, dividend expenses on short sales, brokerage commissions and other transaction costs, and other
expenditures which are capitalized in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles; (iii) expenses incurred indirectly
by the Fund as a result of investments in other investment companies and pooled investment vehicles; (iv) other expenses attributable
to, and incurred as a result of, the Fund’s investments; (v) expenses payable by the Fund under any administration or sub
administration Agreement; (vi) per account charges and anti-money laundering expenses payable by the Fund or its affiliated transfer
agent; and (vii) litigation expenses and extraordinary expenses not incurred in the ordinary course of the Fund’s business),
to the extent that they exceed [•]% per annum of the Fund’s average annual net assets (the “Expense Limitation”).
The Fund intends to pass through to its shareholders any per account charges and anti-money laundering expenses payable under the
terms of the sub-transfer agency agreement. If the Fund incurs expenses excluded from the Expense Limitation Agreement, the Fund’s
expense ratio would be higher and could exceed the Expense Limitation. The Expense Limitation Agreement will remain in effect at
least until one year after the date of the prospectus, unless and until the Board approves its modification or termination. The
Expense Limitation Agreement may be terminated only by the Board. After the expiration of the Expense Limitation Agreement, the
agreement may be renewed at the discretion of the Adviser and the Board. See “Management of the Fund.”</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">The Fund intends to distribute most or all of its net earnings
and realized gains, if any, in the form of dividends from net investment income (“dividends”) and distributions of
net realized capital gains (“capital gain distributions” and, together with dividends, “distributions”).
The Fund intends to declare dividends daily and distribute them to shareholders of record quarterly. Capital gain distributions,
if any, usually will be declared and paid in December. The Fund does not have a fixed distribution rate nor does it guarantee that
it will pay any distributions in any particular period. Unless a shareholder elects otherwise, the shareholder’s distributions
will be reinvested in additional Hanzo UST Coins under the Fund’s distribution reinvestment policy. Shareholders who elect
not to participate in the Fund’s distribution reinvestment policy will receive all distributions in cash paid to the shareholder
of record (or, if the shares are held in street or other nominee name, then to such nominee). See “Distribution Policy”
and “Distribution Reinvestment Policy.”</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Closed-end funds differ from open-end management investment
companies (commonly referred to as mutual funds) in that closed-end funds do not typically redeem their shares at the option of
the shareholder. Rather, closed-end fund shares typically trade in the secondary market via a stock exchange. Unlike many closed-end
funds, however, Hanzo UST Coins will not be listed on a stock exchange. Hanzo UST Coins will be issued as stablecoins, which are
a type of asset-backed digital security that can be traded in a peer-to-peer transaction using a cryptographically-secured distributed
ledger. In the future, Hanzo UST Coins may be available to trade on a decentralized exchange (a “DEX”), or on a closed
trading system that is registered with the SEC as an alternative trading system (an “ATS”).</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Since the use of cryptographically-secured distributed ledger
is not yet widely used in the securities markets, the Fund anticipates that there will be limited liquidity in Fund shares. The
Fund therefore will provide a limited amount of additional liquidity by operating as an interval fund, meaning that the Fund will
offer to repurchase a limited amount of shares (between 5% and 25% of outstanding shares) on a quarterly basis, as discussed in
more detail below.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">An investment in the Fund is suitable only for investors who
can bear the risks associated with the limited liquidity of the shares and should be viewed as a long-term investment. The Fund
is subject to continuous asset in-flows, but not subject to continuous out-flows.</p>

you may lose money. An investment in the Fund is suitable only for investors who can bear the risks associated with limited liquidity
in the shares and the uncertainty of emerging technologies, and should be viewed as a long-term investment. Before making your
investment decision, you should (i) consider the suitability of this investment with respect to your investment objectives and
personal financial situation and (ii) consider factors such as your personal net worth, income, age, risk tolerance and liquidity
needs.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">The Fund will operate as an interval fund and, as such, has
adopted a fundamental policy to make quarterly repurchase offers, at NAV, of no less than 5% and up to 25% of the shares then outstanding.
There is no guarantee that shareholders will be able to sell all of the shares they desire in a quarterly repurchase offer because
shareholders, in total, may wish to sell more than 25% of the Fund’s shares. If the amount of repurchase requests exceeds
the number of shares the Fund offers to repurchase, the Fund will repurchase shares on a pro rata basis. The Fund’s quarterly
repurchases are designed to provide shareholders with limited liquidity. The Fund will maintain liquid securities or cash or, if
available, will borrow in amounts sufficient to meet quarterly redemption requirements. See “Quarterly Repurchases of Shares.”</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Investing in the Fund involves risks, including the risk that
you may receive little or no return on your investment or that you may lose part or all of your investment. Consequently, you can
lose money by investing in the Fund. No assurance can be given that the Fund will achieve its investment objective, and investment
results may vary substantially over time and from period to period. An investment in the Fund is not appropriate for all investors.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">An investment in the Fund is not a deposit of any bank and is
not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) or any other government agency.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: bold 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><u>Risks of Digitized Securities</u></p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">The Fund’s shares will be issued as uncertificated digital
securities (see “About the Digital Securities”) that may be traded in a direct peer-to-peer transaction, on a public
peer-to-peer electronic marketplace, on a DEX, or on an ATS. Only customers of a broker-dealer that is licensed to provide access
to a particular ATS will be able to buy and sell the Fund’s shares on that ATS. Any disruption to the operations of a DEX
or an ATS, including a shareholder’s interface with a DEX or a broker-dealer's interface with an ATS, could materially disrupt
trading in, or potentially result in a complete halt in the trading of, the Fund’s shares on that platform.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">The shares will not be listed for trading on any traditional
stock exchange or through any other national market system (“NMS”) trading platform. In addition, the Fund currently
has no agreements with a DEX or an ATS to make Hanzo UST Coins available through such platforms. Accordingly, you will only be able
to dispose of your Fund shares in a secondary transaction if (i) other eligible investors are available to enter into a direct
peer-to-peer transaction or (ii) through a public peer-to-peer electronic marketplace (which may not currently be available), in
either case, using cryptographically-secured distributed ledger, or blockchain, technology.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0in">When a holder of Hanzo UST Coins chooses to
enter into a peer-to-peer transaction, there is a risk of loss of the holder’s shares either through theft or error. Since
the holder of Hanzo UST Coins in a peer-to-peer transaction necessarily interfaces with another party directly through a digital
wallet application or interface, there is a risk that such interface may be hacked by a third party resulting in a loss of the
holder’s shares. The holder of Hanzo UST Coins may also accidentally lose access to his or her wallet interface and thus lose
access to their shares. Moreover, errors in entering transaction amounts on a digital wallet interface are generally irreversible
without the cooperation of the receiving party.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">If Hanzo UST Coins become available for transactions via an ATS
or a DEX, there will be a risk of theft or loss due to a failure of the underlying systems of such platforms to prevent such theft
or loss. The systems supporting an ATS or a DEX are operated by third parties that interface with investors. Such trading platforms
may be infiltrated by bad actors intent on theft or destruction, or the underlying technology may fail to execute properly or prevent
another failure.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Use of cryptography to secure data related to ownership of and
transactions in the Fund’s shares on a publicly distributed ledger involves the use of algorithms to mathematically prove
the accuracy of transactions by a minimum consensus of participating transaction validators as may be required by each blockchain’s
protocols. Use of this technology in the closed-end fund market is untested, and there may be a limited number of eligible investors
available to participate in such transactions. Accordingly, there may limited liquidity in the Fund’s shares and you may
not be able to sell your shares on a timely basis or at all.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">The Fund expects that if it makes Hanzo UST Coins available for
transactions on a DEX or an ATS, at least initially there is likely to be limited trading volume with a relatively small number
of shares trading on such platforms. A DEX or an ATS may therefore have limited liquidity in Hanzo UST Coins, resulting in a lower
or higher price or greater volatility than would be the case with greater liquidity. Accordingly, even if the Fund’s shares
are traded on a DEX or an ATS, you may not be able to sell your shares on a timely basis or at all. Although the Fund will also

the validity of transactions in the Fund’s shares, will be available to the public and will store the complete trading history
from issuance of the Hanzo UST Coins. As a result, robust and transparent trading data, other than shareholder identity, will be
publicly available via the published distributed ledgers. The shares’ trading data will be secured by cryptography and only
a public-key-derived wallet address (and not a shareholder’s personal identifying information) will be exposed to the public
on a distributed ledger. The personal identifying information necessary to associate a public key representing a given block of
shares with the record owner of those shares will be maintained by the Transfer Agent in a separate database that is not available
to the public. If there are data security breaches with respect to the Transfer Agent’s database resulting in theft of the
information necessary to link personal identity with public keys, the stolen information could be used to determine a shareholder's
complete trading history in the Fund’s shares. Moreover, concerns over these privacy issues may limit adoption of cryptographic

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">As noted, Hanzo UST Coins will be represented by balances written
on one or more distributed ledgers and secured by cryptography. A private key is necessary to affect the sale of a given share
or shares and, as such, is meant to be kept private by or on behalf of a shareholder. In the case of trading on an ATS, the broker-dealer
operating the ATS will usually hold digital securities on an omnibus basis. This is intended to enable shareholders to manage their
accounts with a simple login and password, similar to traditional online brokerage accounts. Fund shares held in such an account
may be as vulnerable to cyber theft as would be a traditional online brokerage account. If the ATS is hacked, the thief could transfer
affected shares to itself and sell the shares. Each broker-dealer licensed to provide access to an ATS with respect to the Fund’s
shares will know the identity of its customers who have access to trading in the shares. The risk of theft of digital securities
is heightened so long as an ATS holds the digital securities on an omnibus basis, because a thief is able to target a single security
system for breach of multiple accounts.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">While a regulated ATS is expected to have adopted policies and
procedures such that shareholders are not free to manipulate the trading price of the Fund’s shares contrary to applicable
law, and while the risk of market manipulation exists in connection with the trading of any security, the risk of manipulation
may be greater if the Fund’s shares trade on an ATS because an ATS is a closed system that does not have the same breadth
of market and liquidity as an NMS. There can be no assurance that the efforts of any ATS (or a broker-dealer licensed to provide
access to such ATS’s digital securities trading platform with respect to the Fund’s shares) will be sufficient to prevent
such market manipulation. For example, there can be no assurance that a shareholder will not be able to manipulate the share price
by opening multiple accounts and trading among those accounts.</p>

one or more distributed ledgers, which will be electronically published on a real time basis. The validity of publicly available
copies of the ledgers can be mathematically proven utilizing cryptographically-secured distributed ledger technology. If, for any
reason, the distributed ledger technology utilized with respect to the Fund’s shares were to become unavailable and suitable
alternative technology were not available to be implemented, investors in the shares would not have a means of proving the validity
of publicly-available copies of the distributed ledgers. As a result, the accuracy of publicly-available trading information could
be called into question and investors could elect to no longer transact in digital securities.</p>

in the same or a related line of business as the Fund does, or of investment funds managed by the Adviser or its affiliates. Similarly,
the Adviser or its affiliates may have other clients with similar, different or competing investment objectives. In serving in
these multiple capacities, they may have obligations to other clients or investors in those entities, the fulfillment of which
may not be in the best interests of the Fund or its shareholders. For example, the Fund’s officers have, and will continue
to have, management responsibilities for other investment funds, accounts or other investment vehicles managed or sponsored by
the Adviser and its affiliates. The Fund’s investment objective may overlap, in part or in whole, with the investment objective
of such affiliated investment funds, accounts or other investment vehicles. As a result, those individuals may face conflicts in
the allocation of investment opportunities among the Fund and other investment funds or accounts advised by or affiliated with
the Adviser. The Adviser will seek to allocate investment opportunities among eligible accounts in a manner that is fair and equitable
over time and consistent with its allocation policy. However, the Fund can offer no assurance that such opportunities will be allocated
to it fairly or equitably in the short-term or over time.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><b><i>Closed-End Fund Risk. </i></b>The Fund is a closed-end
fund. Among other things, closed-end funds differ from open-end management investment companies (commonly referred to as mutual
funds) in that closed-end funds do not redeem their shares at the option of the shareholder, but such shares may be available in
secondary trading markets. By comparison, mutual funds issue securities that are redeemable at net asset value at the option of
the shareholder and typically engage in a continuous offering of their shares. Mutual fund shares, unlike closed-end funds, do
not trade in the secondary market. Mutual funds are subject to continuous asset in-flows and out-flows that can complicate portfolio
management, whereas closed-end funds generally can stay more fully invested in securities consistent with the closed-end fund’s
investment objective and policies. In addition, in comparison to mutual funds or open-end funds, closed-end funds have greater
flexibility in their ability to make certain types of investments, including investments in illiquid securities.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><b><i>Leverage Risk. </i></b>The Fund does not presently intend
within the next 12 months as of the date of this prospectus to issue preferred stock or borrow funds for investment purposes, but
may do so if the Board determines it is in the best interest of the Fund’s common shareholders. If the Fund incurs leverage
as a part of its investment strategy, it will limit overall leverage to 33.33% of the Fund’s total assets immediately after
giving effect to such leverage, as permitted by the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the “1940 Act”). The use of leverage,
such as borrowing money to purchase securities, will cause the Fund to incur additional expenses and may significantly magnify
the Fund’s losses in the event of underperformance of the Fund’s investments. Interest payments and fees incurred in
connection with such borrowings may reduce the amount of distributions available to the Fund’s shareholders.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><b><i>No Minimum Amount of Proceeds Required. </i></b>The Fund
is not required to raise a minimum amount of proceeds from this offering in order to commence operations. In order for the Fund
to have viable operations, the Adviser believes the Fund will need to raise approximately $[25] million in proceeds from this offering.
To the extent that the Fund is unable to raise such amount in a timely manner or at all, it would have a negative impact on the
ability of the Fund to diversify its portfolio and meet the asset diversification requirements to qualify as a regulated investment
company (“RIC”) under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the “Code”).</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><b><i>Distribution Policy Risk. </i></b>The Fund’s distribution
policy may, under certain circumstances, have certain adverse consequences to the Fund and its shareholders because it may result
in a return of capital resulting in less of a shareholder’s assets being invested in the Fund and, over time, increase the
Fund’s expense ratio. A return of capital may also reduce a shareholder’s tax basis, resulting in higher taxes when
the shareholder sells his or her shares, and may cause a shareholder to pay taxes even if he or she sells such shares for less
than the original purchase price. The distribution policy also may cause the Fund to sell a security at a time it would not otherwise
do so in order to manage the distribution of income and gain. The initial distribution will be declared on a date determined by
the Board. If the Fund’s investments are delayed, the initial distribution may consist principally of a return of capital.
Pending the investment of net proceeds in accordance with the Fund’s investment objective and policies, all or a portion
of the Fund’s distributions may consist of a return of capital (i.e. from your original investment). Shareholders should
not assume that the source of a distribution from the Fund is net profit. Shareholders should note that return of capital will
reduce the tax basis of their shares (but not below zero) and potentially increase the taxable gain, if any, upon disposition of
their shares.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><b><i>Market Risk. </i></b>An investment in the Fund’s
shares is subject to investment risk, including the possible loss of the entire principal amount invested. An investment in the
Fund’s shares represents an indirect investment in U.S. Government Securities and Fixed-Income Securities owned by the Fund.
The value of these securities, like other market investments, may move up or down, sometimes rapidly and unpredictably, due to
factors affecting particular companies or the securities markets generally. A general downturn in the securities market may cause
multiple asset classes to decline in value simultaneously. Many factors can affect the value of the Fund’s portfolio and
you may lose money by investing in the Fund.</p>

by the Fund of its shares typically will be funded from available cash or sales of portfolio securities. However, payment for repurchased
shares may require the Fund to liquidate portfolio holdings earlier than the Adviser otherwise would liquidate such holdings, potentially
resulting in losses, and may increase the Fund’s portfolio turnover. The Adviser may take measures to attempt to avoid or
minimize such potential losses and turnover, and instead of liquidating portfolio holdings, may borrow money to finance repurchases
of shares. If the Fund borrows to finance repurchases, interest on any such borrowings will negatively affect shareholders who
do not tender their shares in a repurchase offer by increasing the Fund’s expenses and reducing net investment income.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><b><i>Portfolio Turnover Risk. </i></b>Portfolio turnover risk

for the special tax treatment accorded to RICs and their shareholders under the Code, the Fund must meet certain source of income,
asset diversification and annual distribution requirements. If the Fund were to fail to comply with the income, diversification
or distribution requirements, all of its taxable income regardless of whether timely distributed to shareholders would be subject
to corporate-level tax and all of its distributions from earnings and profits (including from net long-term capital gains) would
be taxable to shareholders as ordinary income. In any such event, the resulting corporate taxes could substantially reduce the
Fund’s net assets, the amount of income available for distribution and the amount of its distributions. Any such failure
would have a material adverse effect on the Fund and its shareholders.</p>

may exercise its right to redeem earlier than expected (a call). Issuers may call outstanding securities prior to their maturity
for a number of reasons (e.g., declining interest rates, changes in credit spreads and improvements in the issuer’s credit
quality). If an issuer calls a security in which the Fund has invested, the Fund may not recoup the full amount of its initial

the value of portfolio securities already held by the Fund can be expected to rise. Conversely, when interest rates rise, the value
of existing portfolio securities can be expected to decline. A fund with a longer average portfolio duration will be more sensitive

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><b><i>Repurchase Agreement Risk. </i></b>If the counterparty
to a repurchase agreement is unable to repurchase the securities as promised, the Fund may experience a loss when trying to sell
the securities to another buyer. Also, if the seller becomes insolvent, a bankruptcy court may determine that the securities do
not belong to the Fund and order that the securities be used to pay off the seller’s debts. The Adviser believes that these
risks are mitigated by limiting the Fund to holding repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. Treasury or U.S. government agency
securities.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><b><i>Illiquid and Restricted Securities Risk. </i></b>Fixed-Income
Investments held by the Fund may become illiquid. Illiquid securities are subject to legal or contractual restrictions on disposition
or lack an established secondary trading market. The sale of restricted and illiquid securities often requires more time and results
in higher brokerage charges or dealer discounts and other selling expenses than does the sale of securities eligible for trading
on national securities exchanges or in the over-the-counter markets. Restricted securities may sell at a price lower than similar
securities that are not subject to restrictions on resale. Furthermore, any of the Fund’s investments in financially stressed
and distressed companies may require a long holding period prior to being able to determine whether the investment will be profitable
or not.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">The Fund intends to elect to be taxed for U.S. federal income
tax purposes, and intends to qualify annually thereafter, as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. As a RIC, the Fund generally
will not have to pay fund-level U.S. federal income taxes on any ordinary income or capital gain that it distributes to its shareholders
from its taxable earnings and profits. Even if the Fund qualifies as a RIC, it generally will be subject to U.S. federal corporate
income tax on its undistributed taxable income and could be subject to U.S. federal excise, state, local and foreign taxes. To
obtain and maintain RIC tax treatment, the Fund must meet specified source-of-income and asset diversification requirements and
distribute annually at least 90% of its ordinary income and net short-term capital gain in excess of net long-term capital loss,
if any. See “U.S. Federal Income Tax Matters.”</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">The Fund is a newly organized, continuously offered, nondiversified,
closed-end management investment company registered under the 1940 Act that intends to operate as an interval fund. The Fund was
organized as a Delaware statutory trust on November 2, 2018, pursuant to a Declaration of Trust, which is governed by the laws
of the State of Delaware. As a newly organized entity, the Fund has no operating history. The Fund’s principal office is
located at 4151 Redwood Ave., Suite 206, Los Angeles, CA 90066, and its telephone number is 424-289-8068.</p>

DIGITAL SECURITIES</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Like securities issued by any other closed-end fund, Hanzo UST
Coins represent an ownership interest in the Fund’s underlying assets. Hanzo UST Coins are, however, solely issued in a digital
format using one or more cryptographically secured distributed ledgers. The “smart contract” written to a particular
ledger enables the Fund and the Transfer Agent to track transactions in the digital securities issued by the Fund on a real-time
basis.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Use of cryptography to secure data related to ownership of and
transactions in securities on a publicly distributed ledger involves the use of algorithms to mathematically prove the accuracy
of transactions by a minimum consensus of participating transaction validators, as may be required by each blockchain’s protocols.
Copies of distributed ledgers, which can be used to prove the validity of the transactions, are generally available to the public
and will store the complete trading history from the date of issuance of the Fund’s shares. Only a public-key-derived wallet
address (and not a shareholder’s personal identifying information) will be available on a distributed ledger.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">A private key is necessary to associate a public key representing
a given share or shares with the record owner of those shares. The personal identifying information attached to such private keys
for Fund shareholders is maintained by the Transfer Agent in a separate database that is not available to the public. The Transfer
Agent will maintain the official record of the Fund’s shareholders and public copies of all transactions effected in the
Fund’s shares will be recorded on the distributed ledgers. No transaction in the Fund’s shares can be effected without
access to the private key.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Holders of Hanzo UST Coins can use electronic “wallets”
to send and receive the Fund’s shares in peer-to-peer transactions without the use of a central clearing agency. Wallets
are software programs that store a shareholder’s public and private keys and that interface directly with other wallets that
contain the Fund’s shares. A shareholder’s wallet has a unique public-key derived wallet address that interfaces with
the distributed ledger; only the public wallet address is discernable on the distributed ledger. The personal identity information
necessary to associate a public key representing a given share or shares with the owner of those shares is in a separate database
that is maintained exclusively by the Transfer Agent.</p>

invested in accordance with the Fund’s investment objective and policies (as stated below) and are expected to be invested

offering expenses incurred with respect to the Fund’s initial offering. Once the Fund has been declared effective by the
SEC and commences operations, the Fund will pay offering expenses incurred with respect to the offering of its shares from the
proceeds of the offering, less amounts advanced under the Expense Limitation. The Fund’s distributions may exceed its earnings
and profits, especially during any period before the Fund has invested substantially all of the proceeds from this offering. As
a result, a portion of the distributions the Fund makes may represent a return of capital for tax purposes. A return of capital
is a return of your investment rather than a return of earnings or gains derived from your investment activities. Any invested
capital that is returned to shareholders will be reduced by the Fund’s fees and expenses.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><b><i>Investment Strategies. </i></b>The Fund pursues its investment
objective by investing, under normal circumstances, at least 80% of its assets in fixed income securities that are issued or guaranteed
by the U.S. government, its agencies or government-sponsored enterprises (“U.S. Government Securities”), which may
be represented by derivatives, such as options, futures or forwards contracts or swap agreements. Assets not invested in U.S. Government
Securities may be invested in other types of fixed income instruments, including bonds, debt securities and other similar instruments
issued by various U.S. and non-U.S. public- or private-sector entities (“Fixed-Income Securities”). Under normal circumstances,
the Fund will have a maximum average portfolio duration of eight years and a dollar-weighted average portfolio maturity of between
zero and eight years.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">The Fund may invest in a variety of Fixed-Income Securities,
as discussed in more detail below. The Fund’s investments in Fixed-Income Securities are limited to investment grade securities
of U.S. issuers that are rated at least A by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. (“Moody’s”), or are equivalently
rated by Standard &amp; Poor’s Ratings Services (“S&amp;P”) or Fitch, Inc. (“Fitch”), or, if unrated,
that are determined by the Adviser to be of comparable quality. The Fund may only invest up to 10% of its total assets in securities
rated A by Moody’s, or equivalently rated by S&amp;P or Fitch, or, if unrated, that are determined by the Adviser to be of
comparable quality.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">The “total return” sought by the Fund consists of
income earned on the Fund’s investments, plus capital appreciation, if any, which generally arises from decreases in interest
rates or improving credit fundamentals for a particular sector or security.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><b><i>Leverage</i></b><i>. </i>The Fund does not presently intend
within the next 12 months as of the date of this prospectus to issue preferred stock or borrow funds for investment purposes, but
may do so if the Board determines that it is in the best interest of shareholders. If the Fund incurs leverage as a part of its
investment strategy, it will limit the overall leverage to 33.33% of the Fund’s total assets immediately after giving effect
to such leverage, as permitted by the 1940 Act.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">The Fund is permitted to obtain traditional leverage using any
form or combination of financial leverage instruments, including through funds borrowed from banks or other financial institutions
(i.e., a credit facility), margin facilities, repurchase agreements, or notes or other debt securities issued by the Fund. Although
it has no current intention to do so, the Fund may issue preferred shares of beneficial interest in an aggregate amount of up to
33.33% of the Fund’s total assets immediately after such issuance. If the Fund uses any such form of traditional leverage,
the amount of fees paid to the Adviser for its services will be higher than if the Fund does not use traditional leverage, because
the fees paid are calculated based on average annual assets, which includes assets purchased with leverage. Therefore, the Adviser
has a financial incentive to use traditional leverage, which creates a conflict of interest between the Adviser and common shareholders,
as only the common shareholders would bear the fees and expenses incurred through the Fund’s use of traditional leverage,
including the issuance of preferred shares, if any. The Fund’s willingness to use traditional leverage, and the extent to
which traditional leverage is used at any time, will depend on many factors. See “Fund Expenses.”</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Any use of leverage by the Fund would be subject to risks and
would cause the Fund’s NAV to be more volatile than if leverage was not used. For example, a rise in short-term interest
rates, which currently are near historically low levels, will cause the Fund’s NAV to decline more than if the Fund had not
used leverage. There is no assurance that the Fund’s leveraging strategies, if employed, will be successful. See “Risk
Factors—Leverage Risk.”</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><b><i>Other Information Regarding Investment Strategies</i></b><i>.
</i>The frequency and amount of portfolio purchases and sales (known as the “portfolio turnover rate”) will vary from
year to year. The Fund’s rate of portfolio turnover will not be a limiting factor for the Adviser in making decisions on
when to buy or sell securities. The Fund reserves full freedom of action related to portfolio turnover. The frequency of the Fund’s
trading will vary from year to year, depending on market conditions. In periods when there are rapid changes in economic conditions
or security price levels, portfolio turnover may be significantly higher than during times of economic and market price stability.
The Fund’s portfolio turnover rate may exceed 100% per year, and under certain market conditions may be substantially higher.
A 100% annual turnover rate would occur, for example, if all securities in the Fund’s portfolio were replaced once within
a period of one year.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Although the Fund generally does not intend to trade for short-term
profits, the Fund may engage in short-term trading strategies, and securities may be sold without regard to the length of time
held when, in the opinion of the Adviser, investment considerations warrant such action, which may result in a larger portion of
any net gains being realized as short-term capital gains. These policies may have the effect of increasing the annual rate of portfolio
turnover of the Fund. Higher rates of portfolio turnover would likely result in higher brokerage commissions and may generate short-term
capital gains taxable as ordinary income. If securities are not held for the applicable holding periods, dividends paid on them
will not qualify for advantageous federal tax rates. See “Tax Status” in the Fund’s SAI.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">There is no assurance what portion, if any, of the Fund’s
investments will qualify for the reduced federal income tax rates applicable to qualified dividends under the Code. As a result,
there can be no assurance as to what portion of the Fund’s distributions will be designated as qualified dividend income.

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Hanzo UST Coins are intended to function as stablecoins. The
goal of stablecoins is to maintain a stable value vis-à-vis the underlying reference asset, which itself is generally known
for having a stable value. In general, the value of stablecoins is pegged to the value of a reference asset such as U.S. dollars,
other fiat currencies, gold, or other assets with relatively stable values. In the case of Hanzo UST Coins, the reference asset
is the Fund’s portfolio, which will be composed primarily of U.S. Government Securities. Stablecoins are desired by their
purchasers and sellers for use in commerce, trading, and as a store of value due to the stablecoins’ lack of material volatility
under normal market conditions.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Hanzo believes that Hanzo UST Coins will be the first stablecoins
offered with a managed portfolio of U.S. Government Securities as a reference asset and the first offered through a registered
investment company structure. Hanzo believes that Hanzo UST Coins will be attractive investments for participants in the cryptocurrency
community because the Fund is subject to the regulatory protection provided by the Federal securities laws, including oversight
by a board of directors that has a majority of members that are not affiliated with the Fund or Hanzo. As a regulated product, the
Fund is subject to public disclosure and reporting requirements under the Federal securities laws, and therefore, will have a relatively
high level of transparency. In addition, Hanzo believes that the Fund’s focus on investments in U.S. Government Securities,
and the quarterly opportunity to redeem a limited number of Fund shares for fiat currency, will be attractive to participants in
the cryptocurrency community.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">The Fund may invest, but is under no obligation to invest, in
the following types of securities, subject to certain limitations as set forth below.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><b><i>Mortgage-Backed Securities. </i></b>The Fund may invest
in mortgage-backed securities. Common examples of mortgage backed securities include commercial mortgage-backed securities (“CMBS”)
and residential mortgage-backed securities (“RMBS”). Mortgage-backed securities differ from conventional fixed-income
securities because principal is paid back over the life of the security rather than at maturity. The Fund may receive unscheduled
prepayments of principal before the security’s maturity date due to voluntary prepayments, refinancings, or foreclosures
on the underlying mortgage loans. To the Fund this means a loss of anticipated interest and a portion of its principal investment
represented by any premium the Fund may have paid. Mortgage prepayments generally increase when interest rates fall. Mortgage-backed
securities also are subject to extension risk, which can happen when rising interest rates can cause mortgage-backed securities’
average maturity to lengthen unexpectedly due to a drop in mortgage prepayments. This will increase a mortgage-backed security’s
sensitivity to rising interest rates and its potential for price declines.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><b><i>Preferred Stock. </i></b>The Fund may invest in preferred
stock. Preferred stocks are equity securities, but they have many characteristics of fixed income securities, such as a fixed dividend
payment rate and/or a liquidity preference over the issuer’s common shares. However, because preferred stocks are equity
securities, they may be more susceptible to risks traditionally associated with equity investments than the Fund’s holdings
of Fixed-Income Securities. Preferred stocks owned by the Fund may include fixed rate preferred stock, preferred stock that is
convertible into other equity securities, adjustable rate preferred stock or auction rate preferred stock.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><b><i>Convertible Securities. </i></b>The Fund may invest in
convertible securities, which may offer higher income than the common stocks into which they are convertible and include fixed-income
or zero coupon debt securities, which may be converted or exchanged at a stated or determinable exchange ratio into underlying
shares of common stock. Prior to their conversion, convertible securities may have characteristics similar to both non-convertible
debt securities and equity securities. While convertible securities generally offer lower yields than non-convertible debt securities
of similar quality, their prices may reflect changes in the value of the underlying common stock. Generally, convertible securities
have less credit risk than the issuer’s common stock.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><b><i>Restricted and Illiquid Securities. </i></b>The Fund may
purchase Fixed-Income Securities that are not liquid or that have restrictions on the ability to transfer such securities. The
Fund may not be able to readily dispose of illiquid securities at prices that approximate those at which the Fund could sell such
securities if they were more widely traded and, as a result of such illiquidity, the Fund may have to sell other investments or
engage in borrowing transactions if necessary to raise cash to meet its obligations.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">The Fund may purchase certain securities (“Rule 144A Securities”)
eligible for resale to qualified institutional buyers as contemplated by Rule 144A under the Securities Act. Rule 144A provides
an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act for the resale of certain restricted securities to certain
qualified institutional buyers. One effect of Rule 144A is that certain restricted securities may be considered liquid, though
no assurance can be given that a liquid market for Rule 144A Securities will develop or be maintained. However, where a substantial
market of qualified institutional buyers has developed for certain unregistered securities purchased by the Fund pursuant to Rule
144A under the Securities Act, the Fund intends to treat such securities as liquid securities in accordance with procedures approved
by the Board. Because it is not possible to predict with assurance how the market for Rule 144A Securities will develop, the Board
has directed the Adviser to carefully monitor the Fund’s investments in such securities, particularly with respect to trading
activity, availability of reliable price information and other relevant information. To the extent that, for a period of time,
qualified institutional buyers cease purchasing restricted securities pursuant to Rule 144A, the Fund’s investing in such
securities may have the effect of increasing the level of illiquidity in its investment portfolio during such period.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><b><i>Investment Grade Securities. </i></b>The Fund may invest
in a wide variety of Fixed-Income Securities of varying maturities issued by U.S. corporations and other business entities that
are rated at least A by Moody’s, or an equivalent rating by S&amp;P or Fitch, or that are determined by the Adviser to be
of investment grade quality. Bonds are fixed or variable rate debt obligations, including bills, notes, debentures, money market
instruments and similar instruments and securities. Bonds generally are used by corporations and other issuers to borrow money
from investors for a variety of business purposes. The issuer pays the investor a fixed or variable rate of interest and normally
must repay the amount borrowed on or before maturity. Certain bonds are “perpetual” in that they have no maturity date.
Some investment grade securities, such as zero coupon bonds, do not pay current interest, but are sold at a discount from their
face values.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><b><i>Other Fixed-Income Securities. </i></b>The Fund also may
purchase floating rate or fixed rate debt securities such as notes, bonds, asset-backed securities (such as securities issued by
special purpose funds investing in bank loans), investment grade and below investment grade fixed income debt obligations and money
market instruments, such as commercial paper. The Fund’s holdings in Fixed-Income Securities may have fixed or variable principal
payments and all types of interest rate and dividend payment and reset terms, including fixed rate, adjustable rate, zero coupon,
contingent, deferred, payment in kind and auction rate features. The Fund may invest in fixed-income securities with a broad range
of maturities.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">The Fund may invest in zero coupon bonds, deferred interest
bonds and bonds or preferred stock on which the interest is payable-in-kind (“PIK bonds”). To the extent the Fund invests
in such instruments, they will not contribute to the Fund’s goal of current income. Zero coupon and deferred interest bonds
are debt obligations that are issued at a significant discount from face value. While zero coupon bonds do not require the periodic
payment of interest, deferred interest bonds provide for a period of delay before the regular payment of interest begins. PIK bonds
are debt obligations that provide that the issuer thereof may, at its option, pay interest on such bonds in cash or in the form
of additional debt obligations. Such investments may experience greater volatility in market value due to changes in interest rates.
The Fund may be required to accrue income on these investments for U.S. federal income tax purposes even though the Fund receives
no corresponding interest payment in cash on the investments. As a result, in order to receive the special treatment accorded to
RICs and their shareholders under the Code and to avoid any U.S. federal income or excise taxes at the Fund level, the Fund may
be required to pay out, as an income distribution each year, an amount greater than the total amount of interest and other income
the Fund actually received. The Fund may be required to, among other things, sell securities, including at potentially disadvantageous
times or prices, to obtain cash needed for income distributions, and may realize gain or loss from such liquidations. In the event
that the Fund realizes net long-term or short-term capital gains from such liquidation transactions, its shareholders may receive
larger capital gain or ordinary dividends, respectively, than they would in the absence of such transactions.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><b><i>Collateralized Loan Obligations and Bond Obligations.
</i></b>The Fund may invest in collateralized debt obligations (“CDOs”), which include collateralized bond obligations
(“CBOs”) and collateralized loan obligations (“CLOs”). CDOs are asset-backed securities that securitize
certain financial assets by issuing securities in the form of negotiable paper that are issued by a financing company (generally
called a Special Purpose Vehicle or an “SPV”) created to reapportion the risk and return characteristics of a pool
of assets, whose underlying collateral is typically a portfolio of loans, bonds or other debt securities, other structured finance
securities and/or synthetic instruments. These securitized assets are, as a rule, corporate financial assets brought into a pool
according to specific diversification rules. The SPV is a company founded solely for the purpose of securitizing these claims and
its only asset is the diversified asset pool. On this basis, marketable securities are issued which, due to the diversification
of the underlying risk, are generally considered to represent a lower level of risk than the original assets. The redemption of
the securities issued by the SPV takes place at maturity out of the cash flow generated by the collateral. CDOs may charge management
fees and administrative expenses, which are in addition to those of a fund.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Where the underlying collateral is a portfolio of loans, which
may include, among others, domestic and foreign senior secured loans, senior unsecured loans, and subordinate corporate loans,
including loans that may be rated below investment grade or equivalent unrated loans, a CDO is referred to as a CLO. The assets,
typically senior loans, are used as collateral supporting the various debt and equity tranches issued by the SPV. Where the underlying
collateral is a portfolio of bonds, a CDO is referred to as a CBO. The key feature of the CLO or CBO structure is the prioritization
of the cash flows from a pool of collateral securities among the several tranches of the CLO or CBO. Multiple tranches of securities
are issued by the CLO or CBO, offering investors various maturity and credit risk characteristics. Tranches are categorized as
senior, mezzanine, and subordinated/equity, according to their degree of risk. The most senior tranche of a CDO or CBO has the
greatest collateralization and pays the lowest interest rate. If there are defaults or the collateral otherwise underperforms,
scheduled payments to senior tranches take precedence over those of mezzanine tranches, and scheduled payments to mezzanine tranches
take precedence over those to subordinated/equity tranches. Lower tranches represent lower degrees of credit quality and pay higher
interest rates intended to compensate for the attendant risks. The return on the lower tranches is especially sensitive to the
rate of defaults in the collateral pool. The lowest tranche (i.e. the “equity” or “residual” tranche) specifically
receives the residual interest payments (i.e., money that is left over after the higher tranches have been paid) rather than a
fixed interest rate. CDOs or CBOs are subject to the risk of prepayment.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">An equity tranche is the riskiest type of tranche as it bears
the first loss from defaults from the bonds or loans in the SPV and serves to protect the other, more senior tranches from default
in all but the most severe circumstances (though such protection is not complete). Since it is partially protected from defaults,
a senior tranche from a CBO trust or CLO trust typically has higher ratings and lower yields than its underlying securities, and
can be rated investment grade. Despite the protection from the equity tranche, CBO or CLO tranches can experience substantial losses
due to actual defaults, increased sensitivity to defaults due to collateral default and disappearance of protecting tranches, market
anticipation of defaults, as well as aversion to CBO or CLO securities as a class. Further, the value of CLOs or CBOs may be affected
by changes in the market’s perception of the creditworthiness of the servicing agent for the pool, the originator of the
pool, or the financial institution or fund providing the credit support or enhancement. The Fund may invest in both equity and
debt tranches issued by the SPV. The Fund will only invest in equity tranches through the secondary market. Under normal market
conditions, the Fund expects to invest in the lower tranches of CBOs and CLOs, including equity tranches.</p>

The value of the Fund’s investments will increase or decrease based on changes in the prices of the investments it holds.
This will cause the value of the Fund’s shares to increase or decrease. You could lose money by investing in the Fund. By

they are the principal risks associated with an investment in the Fund, as well as generally associated with an investment in a
fund with investment objectives, investment policies, capital structure or trading markets similar to the Fund’s. Additional
risks and uncertainties not currently known to the Fund or that are currently immaterial may also materially adversely affect the

a portion of the Fund’s distributions may consist of a return of capital (i.e. from your original investment). Shareholders
should not assume that the source of a distribution from the Fund is net profit. Shareholders should note that return of capital
will reduce the tax basis of their shares (but not below zero) and potentially increase the taxable gain, if any, upon disposition
of their shares.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><b><i>Liquidity Risk</i></b>. The shares will not be listed
for trading on any traditional stock exchange or through any other national market system, or NMS, trading platform. In addition,
the Fund currently has no agreements with a DEX or an ATS to trade its shares. Accordingly, you will only be able to dispose of
your Fund shares in a secondary transaction if other eligible investors are available to enter into a direct peer-to-peer transaction
or a transaction on a public peer-to-peer trading platform using distributed ledger technology. Use of distributed ledger technology
for transactions in digital securities is largely untested, and there may be a limited number of eligible investors available to
participate in such transactions. Accordingly, there may limited liquidity in the Fund’s shares and you may not be able to
sell your shares on a timely basis or at all.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">The Fund expects that if it lists its shares for trading on
a DEX or an ATS, there is likely to be a relatively small number of shares trading on such platform as compared to closed-end fund
securities listed and traded on a traditional stock exchange or NMS. A DEX or an ATS may therefore have limited liquidity in the
Fund’s shares, resulting in a lower or higher price or greater volatility than would be the case with greater liquidity.
Accordingly, even if the Fund’s shares are traded on a DEX or an ATS, you may not be able to resell your shares on a timely
basis or at all. Although the Fund will also provide limited liquidity through its quarterly repurchase offers for between 5% and
25% of the Fund’s shares outstanding, there is no guarantee that shareholders will be able to sell all of the shares they
desire in a quarterly repurchase offer.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><b><i>Risks Relating to the Fund’s Tax Status</i></b><i>.
</i>To remain eligible for the special tax treatment accorded to RICs and their shareholders under the Code, the Fund must meet
certain source of income, asset diversification and annual distribution requirements. Very generally, in order to qualify as a
RIC, the Fund must derive at least 90% of its gross income for each taxable year from dividends, interest, payments with respect
to certain securities loans, gains from the sale or other disposition of stock, securities or foreign currencies, or other income
derived with respect to its business of investing in stock or other securities. In some cases, if the Fund fails to meet these
income requirements at the end of a taxable year, it will be able to cure such failure by paying a Fund-level tax to avoid the
loss of its RIC status; such tax could be substantial. The Fund must also meet certain asset diversification requirements at the
end of each quarter of each of its taxable years. Failure to meet these diversification requirements on the last day of a quarter
will result in the Fund’s loss of RIC status, unless it is able to cure such failure, for instance, by disposing of certain
investments, including at disadvantageous times and prices, and, in some cases, by paying a Fund-level tax.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">In addition, in order to be eligible for the special tax treatment
accorded RICs, the Fund must meet the annual distribution requirement, requiring it to distribute with respect to each taxable
year at least 90% of the sum of its “investment company taxable income” (generally-its taxable ordinary income and
realized net short-term capital gains in excess of realized net long-term capital losses, if any) and its net tax-exempt income
(if any), to its shareholders. If the Fund fails to meet the annual distribution requirement or either of the RIC qualification
requirements in respect of a taxable year and is ineligible to or otherwise does not cure such failure for any such year, all of
its taxable income regardless of whether timely distributed to shareholders will be subject to fund-level tax at the applicable
corporate income tax rate and all of its distributions from earnings and profits (including from net long-term capital gains) will
be taxable to shareholders as ordinary income. In any such event, the resulting corporate taxes could substantially reduce its
net assets, the amount of income available for distribution and the amount of its distributions. Such a failure would have a material
adverse effect on the Fund and its shareholders. In addition, in some cases, the Fund could be required to recognize unrealized
gains, pay substantial taxes and interest and make substantial distributions in order to re-qualify as a RIC.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><b><i>Operational and Technology Risk</i></b><i>. </i>The Fund,
its service providers, and other market participants increasingly depend on complex information technology and communications systems
to conduct business functions. These systems are subject to a number of different threats or risks that could adversely affect
the Fund and its shareholders, despite the efforts of the Fund and its service providers to adopt technologies, processes, and
practices intended to mitigate these risks. For example, unauthorized third parties may attempt to improperly access, modify, disrupt
the operations of, or prevent access to these systems of the Fund, the Fund’s service providers, counterparties, or other
market participants or data within them (a “cyber-attack”).</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Power or communications outages, acts of god, information technology
equipment malfunctions, operational errors, and inaccuracies within software or data processing systems may also disrupt business
operations or impact critical data. Market events also may trigger a volume of transactions that overloads current information
technology and communication systems and processes, impacting the ability to conduct the Fund’s operations.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Cyber-attacks, disruptions, or failures that affect the Fund’s
service providers or counterparties may adversely affect the Fund and its shareholders, including by causing losses for the Fund
or impairing Fund operations. For example, the Fund’s or its service providers’ assets or sensitive or confidential
information may be misappropriated, data may be corrupted, and operations may be disrupted (e.g., cyberattacks or operational failures
may cause the release of private shareholder information or confidential Fund information, interfere with the processing of shareholder
transactions, impact the ability to calculate the Fund’s NAV, and impede trading). In addition, cyber-attacks, disruptions,
or failures may cause reputational damage and subject the Fund or its service providers to regulatory fines, litigation costs,
penalties or financial losses, reimbursement or other compensation costs, and/or additional compliance costs.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">While the Fund and its service providers may establish business
continuity and other plans and processes to address the possibility of cyber-attacks, disruptions, or failures, there are inherent
limitations in such plans and systems, including that they do not apply to third parties, such as other market participants, as
well as the possibility that certain risks have not been identified or that unknown threats may emerge in the future.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Similar types of operational and technology risks are also present
for issuers of the Fund’s investments, which could have material adverse consequences for such issuers, and may cause the
Fund’s investments to lose value. In addition, cyber-attacks involving a Fund counterparty could affect such counterparty’s
ability to meet its obligations to the Fund, which may result in losses to the Fund and its shareholders. Furthermore, as a result
of cyber-attacks, disruptions, or failures, an exchange or market may close or issue trading halts on specific securities or the
entire market, which may result in the Funds being, among other things, unable to buy or sell certain securities or financial instruments
or unable to accurately price its investments. The Fund cannot directly control any cybersecurity plans and systems put in place
by its service providers, Fund counterparties, issuers in which the Fund invests, or securities markets and exchanges.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><b><i>Non-Payment Risk</i></b>. Fixed-Income Securities are
subject to the risk of non-payment of scheduled interest and/or principal. Nonpayment would result in a reduction of income to
the Fund, a reduction in the value of the security experiencing nonpayment and a potential decrease in the NAV of the Fund. There
can be no assurance that the liquidation of any collateral would satisfy the borrower’s obligation in the event of non-payment
of scheduled interest or principal payments, or that such collateral could be readily liquidated.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><b><i>Interest Rate Risk</i></b>. When interest rates decline,
the value of Fixed-Income Securities held by the Fund can be expected to rise. Conversely, when interest rates rise, the value
of Fixed-Income Securities held by the Fund can be expected to decline. To the extent the Fund invests in Fixed-Income Securities
with longer maturities, the Fund is subject to greater interest rate risk than funds investing solely in shorter-term Fixed-Income
Securities. In addition, the interest rates of floating rate loans typically only adjust to changes in short-term interest rates;
long-term interest rates can vary dramatically from short-term interest rates. In a period of rising interest rates, the higher
cost of any leverage employed by the Fund and/or increasing defaults by issuers of high-yield securities would likely exacerbate
any decline in the Fund’s NAV. If an issuer of a debt security containing a redemption or call provision exercises either
provision in a declining interest rate market, the Fund would likely replace the security with a security having a lower interest
rate, which could result in a decreased return for shareholders.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><b><i>Credit Risk</i>. </b>Credit risk is the risk that the
issuers of certain Fixed-Income Securities or the counterparties of a derivatives contract or repurchase contract might be unable
or unwilling (or perceived as being unable or unwilling) to make interest and/or principal payments when due, or to otherwise honor
its obligations. Fixed-Income Securities are subject to the risk of non-payment of scheduled interest and/or principal. Non-payment
would result in a reduction of income to the Fund, a reduction in the value of the obligation experiencing non-payment and a potential
decrease in the NAV of the Fund.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><b><i>Liquidity Risk</i></b><i>. </i>Liquidity risk is the risk
that low trading volume, lack of a market maker, large position size, or legal restrictions (including daily price fluctuation
limits or “circuit breakers”) limits or prevents the Fund from selling particular securities or unwinding derivative
positions at desirable prices. At times, a major portion of any portfolio security may be held by relatively few institutional
purchasers. Even if the Fund considers such securities liquid because of the availability of an institutional market, such securities
may become difficult to value or sell in adverse market or economic conditions. As a result, the Fund may maintain higher levels
of cash and short-term investments than mutual funds that invest in securities with shorter settlement cycles and/or may enter
into a line of credit to permit the Fund to finance redemptions pending settlement of the sale of portfolio securities, each of
which may adversely affect the Fund’s performance. No assurance can be given that these measures will provide the Fund with
sufficient liquidity in the event of abnormally large redemptions.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><b><i>Valuation Risk</i></b>. If a security held by the Fund
does not have a market value, the security will be “fair valued” in good faith under procedures adopted by the Board.
Fair value is defined as the amount for which assets could be sold in an orderly disposition over a reasonable period of time,
taking into account the nature of the asset. Fair value pricing, however, involves judgments that are inherently subjective and
inexact, since fair valuation procedures are used only when it is not possible to be sure what value should be attributed to a
particular asset or when an event will affect the market price of an asset and to what extent. As a result, fair value pricing
may not reflect actual market value, and it is possible that the fair value determined for a security will be materially different
from the value that actually could be or is realized upon the sale of that asset.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><b><i>Preferred Stock Risk. </i></b>The market value of preferred
stocks may be affected by favorable and unfavorable changes impacting companies in the utilities and financial services sectors,
which are prominent issuers of preferred stocks, and by actual and anticipated changes in tax laws, such as changes in U.S. federal
corporate income tax rates or the dividends-received deduction. Because the claim on an issuer’s earnings represented by
traditional preferred stocks may become onerous when interest rates fall below the rate payable on such stocks, the issuer may
redeem the stocks. Thus, in declining interest rate environments in particular, the Fund’s holdings of higher rate-paying
fixed rate preferred stocks may be reduced and the Fund would be unable to acquire securities of comparable credit quality paying
comparable rates with the redemption proceeds.</p>

of any default under a mortgage loan held by the Fund, the Fund will bear a risk of loss of principal to the extent of any deficiency
between the value of the collateral and the principal and accrued interest of the mortgage loan. Foreclosure of a mortgage loan
can be an expensive and lengthy process that could have a substantial negative effect on anticipated returns on the foreclosed
mortgage loan.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Investments in commercial real estate loans are subject to changes
in credit spreads. When credit spreads widen, the economic value of such investments decrease. Even though a loan may be performing
in accordance with its loan agreement and the underlying collateral has not changed, the economic value of the loan may be negatively
impacted by the incremental interest foregone from the widened credit spread.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">The value of mortgage-backed securities may change due to shifts
in the market’s perception of issuers and regulatory or tax changes adversely affecting the mortgage securities market as
a whole. Mortgage-backed securities are also subject to several risks created through the securitization process. Subordinate mortgage-backed
securities are paid interest only to the extent that there are funds available to make payments. To the extent the collateral pool
includes delinquent loans, there is a risk that the interest payment on subordinate mortgage-backed securities will not be fully
paid. Subordinate mortgage-backed securities are also subject to greater credit risk than those mortgage-backed securities that
are more highly rated.</p>

Mr. Dorman has over 17 years’ experience in trading and asset management, and works closely with other members of Hanzo’s
investment committee to execute the Fund’s investment strategies. From November 2013 to April 2018, Mr. Dorman was, successively,
Vice President of Business Development and Chief Operating Officer of Harvest Exchange Corp. (“Harvest”), an online
investment portal and financial technology company focusing on research for institutional investors, in New York and Los Angeles.
Prior to Harvest, Mr. Dorman was a trader at Global Credit Advisers, LLC, a New York City registered investment adviser and asset
management firm, where he managed the then-newly launched Event Driven strategy and managed outside capital by investing in highly-volatile,
thinly-traded securities with a strict discipline approach around position sizing and liquidity. Mr. Dorman was also Head Trader
at Brencourt Advisors (“Brencourt”), a multi-strategy registered investment adviser, where he co-managed a more than
$200 million credit opportunity hedge fund focused on trading illiquid debt and equity securities. Mr. Dorman also created a proprietary
risk management system while at Brencourt that helped the fund determine appropriate sizing and rebalancing for each portfolio
position using both quantitative factors (such as position liquidity and number of market makers), and qualitative factors (such
as upside potential, downside risk and timing of an event) to create an optimal-sized position. While at Brencourt, Mr. Dorman
was a member of the firm’s investment committee. Mr. Dorman’s experience also includes being senior trader with responsibility

the services stated in the Investment Advisory Agreement, including compensation of and office space for its officers and employees
connected with investment and economic research, trading and investment management and administration of the Fund. The Adviser
is obligated to pay the fees of any Trustee of the Fund who is affiliated with the Adviser.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Assuming the Fund sells all of the securities registered in
this offering within three years of the effective date of the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part, it
is estimated that the Fund’s other operating expenses will be approximately $[•] annually, which includes offering costs
but does not include management fees, shareholder servicing fees or interest expense. In addition, this estimate does not take
into account the effect, if any, of the Expense Limitation Agreement between the Fund and the Adviser. However, no assurance can
be given, in light of the Fund’s investment objective and policies and the fact that the Fund’s offering is continuous
and shares are sold on an ongoing basis that actual annual operating expenses will not be substantially more or less than this
estimate. In addition, there can be no assurance that the Fund will sell all or substantially all of the securities registered
in this offering.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">The initial operating expenses for a new fund, including start-up
costs, which may be significant, may be higher than the expenses of an established fund. Costs incurred in connection with the
initial organization of the Fund, estimated at $[•], will be borne by the Adviser. The Adviser will pay organizational costs
and initial offering expenses incurred with respect to the offering of the Fund’s Shares. Once the Fund has been declared
effective by the SEC and commenced operations, the Fund will pay offering expenses incurred with respect to the offering of its
Shares from the proceeds of the offering, less amounts advanced under the Expense Limitation. For tax purposes, offering costs
cannot be deducted by the Fund or the Fund’s shareholders. Therefore, for tax purposes, the expenses incurred by the Fund

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">The net asset value (or NAV) of shares of the Fund is determined
daily, as of the close of regular trading on the NYSE (normally, 4:00 p.m., Eastern time) on each day that the NYSE is open for
business. The Fund’s shares will be offered at NAV. During the continuous offering, the price of the shares will increase
or decrease on a daily basis according to the NAV of the shares.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">The Fund uses the following valuation methods to determine either

be the last reported sale price at the relevant valuation date on the composite tape or on the principal exchange on which such

pricing quotations from principal market makers. Such quotations may be obtained from third-party pricing services or directly
from investment brokers and dealers in the secondary market. Generally, the Fund’s portfolio positions are not traded on
exchanges and consequently are valued based on market prices received from third-party pricing services or broker-dealer sources.</td></tr></tbody></table>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">When determining the fair value of an asset, the Adviser will
seek to determine the price that the Fund might reasonably expect to receive from the current sale of that asset in an arm’s
length transaction. Fair value is defined as the amount for which assets could be sold in an orderly disposition over a reasonable
period of time, taking into account the nature of the asset. Fair value determinations are based upon all available factors that
the Adviser deems relevant. Fair value pricing, however, involves judgments that are inherently subjective and inexact, since fair
valuation procedures are used only when it is not possible to be sure what value should be attributed to a particular asset or
when an event will affect the market price of an asset and to what extent. As a result, fair value pricing may not reflect actual
market value, and it is possible that the fair value determined for a security will be materially different from the value that
actually could be or is realized upon the sale of that asset.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">The Adviser will provide the Board with periodic reports, no
less frequently than quarterly, that discuss the functioning of the valuation process, if applicable to that period, and that identify
issues and valuation problems that have arisen, if any.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">As a general matter, certain conflicts of interest may arise
in connection with a portfolio manager’s management of a fund’s investments, on the one hand, and the investments of
other accounts for which the portfolio managers are responsible, on the other. For example, it is possible that the various accounts
managed could have different investment strategies that, at times, might conflict with one another to the possible detriment of
the Fund. Alternatively, to the extent that the same investment opportunities might be desirable for more than one account, possible
conflicts could arise in determining how to allocate them. Other potential conflicts might include conflicts created by specific
portfolio manager compensation arrangements, and conflicts relating to selection of brokers or dealers to execute Fund portfolio
trades and/or specific uses of commissions from Fund portfolio trades (for example, research, or “soft dollars,” if
any). The Adviser has adopted policies and procedures and has structured its portfolio managers’ compensation in a manner
reasonably designed to safeguard the Fund from being negatively affected as a result of any such potential conflicts. These policies
and procedures generally require that the Adviser distribute investment opportunities among client accounts in a fair and equitable
manner (<i>i.e., </i>on a pro rata basis, relative to the size of the order) and seek best execution for securities transactions
executed on the Fund’s behalf.</p>

The Adviser will seek to allocate investment opportunities among such entities in a manner that is fair and equitable over time

to the Fund fairly or equitably in the short-term or over time and there can be no assurance that the Fund will be able to participate
in all such investment opportunities that are suitable for it. Please see “Risk Factors—Conflicts of Interest”

POLICY</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">The Fund’s distribution policy is to make quarterly distributions
to shareholders. If, for any distribution, investment company taxable income (which term includes net short-term capital gain),
if any, and net tax-exempt income, if any, is less than the amount of the distribution, then assets of the Fund will be sold and
the difference will generally be a tax-free return of capital distributed from the Fund’s assets. The Fund’s final
distribution for each calendar year will include any remaining investment company taxable income and net tax-exempt income undistributed
during the year, as well as all net capital gain realized during the year. If the total distributions made in any calendar year
exceed investment company taxable income, net tax-exempt income and net capital gain, such excess distributed amount would be treated
as ordinary dividend income to the extent of the Fund’s current and accumulated earnings and profits. Distributions in excess
of the earnings and profits would first be a tax-free return of capital to the extent of the adjusted tax basis in the shares.
After such adjusted tax basis is reduced to zero, the distribution would constitute capital gain (assuming the shares are held
as capital assets).</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">This distribution policy may, under certain circumstances, have
certain adverse consequences to the Fund and its shareholders because it may result in a return of capital resulting in less of
a shareholder’s assets being invested in the Fund which, over time, would increase the Fund’s expense ratio and reduce
shareholder returns. The distribution policy also may cause the Fund to sell a security at a time it would not otherwise do so
in order to manage the distribution of income and gain. The initial distribution will be declared on a date determined by the Board.
If the Fund’s investments are delayed, the initial distribution may consist principally of a return of capital.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Unless the registered owner of shares elects to receive cash,
all dividends declared on shares will be automatically reinvested in additional shares of the Fund. See “Distribution Reinvestment
Policy.”</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">The dividend distribution described above may result in the
payment of approximately the same amount or percentage to the Fund’s shareholders each period. The dividend distribution
that the Fund pays to shareholders may vary as portfolio and market conditions change, and will depend on a number of factors.
There can be no assurance that a change in market conditions or other factors will not result in a change in the dividend distribution
or that any dividends received will be sustainable in the future.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Shareholders receiving periodic payments from the Fund may be
under the impression that they are receiving net profits. However, all or a portion of a distribution may consist of a return of
capital. Shareholders should not assume that the source of a distribution from the Fund is net profit. A return of capital is not
taxable to a shareholder unless it exceeds a shareholder’s tax basis in the shares. Returns of capital reduce a shareholder’s
tax cost (or “tax basis”). Once a shareholder’s tax basis is reduced to zero, any further return of capital would
be taxable. Shareholders should note that return of capital will reduce the tax basis of their shares and potentially increase
the taxable gain, if any, upon disposition of their shares. As required under Section 19(a) of the 1940 Act, the Fund will provide
a notice to shareholders at the time of distribution when such distribution does not consist solely of net income. Additionally,
each distribution payment will be accompanied by a written statement which discloses the source or sources of each distribution.
The IRS requires you to report these amounts, excluding returns of capital, on your income tax return for the year declared. The
Fund will provide disclosures, with each distribution, that estimate the percentages of the current and year-to-date distributions
that represent (1) net investment income, (2) capital gains and (3) return of capital. At the end of the year, the Fund may be
required under applicable law to re-characterize distributions made previously during that year among (1) ordinary income, (2)
capital gains and (3) return of capital for tax purposes. An additional distribution may be made in December, and other additional
distributions may be made with respect to a particular fiscal year in order to comply with applicable law. Shareholders should
read any written disclosure provided pursuant to Section 19(a) and Rule 19a-1 carefully and should not assume that the source of
any distribution from the Fund is net profit.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">The Fund will operate under a distribution reinvestment policy
administered by the Transfer Agent. Pursuant to the policy, the Fund’s income dividends or capital gains or other distributions
(each, a “Distribution” and collectively, “Distributions”), net of any applicable U.S. withholding tax,
are reinvested in shares of the Fund.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Shareholders automatically participate in the distribution reinvestment
policy, unless and until an election is made to withdraw from the policy on behalf of a participating shareholder. Shareholders
who do not wish to have Distributions automatically reinvested or would like additional information about the distribution reinvestment
policy should so notify the Transfer Agent in writing at Hanzo U.S. Treasury Fund, c/o Hanzo Transfer Agency, LLC. Such written notice
must be received by the Transfer Agent 30 days prior to the record date of the Distribution or the shareholder will receive such
Distribution in shares through the distribution reinvestment policy. Under the distribution reinvestment policy, the Fund’s
Distributions to shareholders are reinvested in full and fractional shares as described below.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">When the Fund declares a Distribution, the Transfer Agent, on
the shareholder’s behalf, will receive additional authorized shares from the Fund either newly-issued or repurchased from
shareholders by the Fund and held as treasury stock. The number of shares to be received when Distributions are reinvested will
be determined by dividing the amount of the Distribution by the Fund’s NAV per Share.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">The Transfer Agent will maintain the ledger containing all shareholder
personal identifying information applicable to the transactions recorded on the distributed ledger. The Transfer Agent will furnish
written confirmations of all transactions in the accounts, including information needed by shareholders for personal and tax records,
as required by the federal securities laws and the Code. The Transfer Agent will maintain a record of the account of each shareholder,
including the number of digital shares held in the name of the participant. For purposes of determining the number of shares held
by each shareholder as of the record date for any shareholder vote, the Transfer Agent will include those shares purchased pursuant
to the distribution reinvestment policy. The Fund’s shares will be issued solely in digitized format. Accordingly, the Transfer
Agent will access the distributed ledgers once daily to update the shareholder records. The Transfer Agent will distribute all
proxy solicitation materials, if any, to participating shareholders.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">In the case of shareholders such as banks, brokers or nominees
that hold the Fund’s shares for beneficial owners participating under the distribution reinvestment policy, the Transfer
Agent will administer the distribution reinvestment policy on the basis of the number of shares held from time to time by the record
shareholder as representing the total amount of shares registered in the shareholder’s name and held for the account of beneficial
owners participating under the distribution reinvestment policy.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">The following briefly summarizes some of the important federal
income tax consequences to shareholders of investing in the Fund’s Shares, reflects the federal tax law as of the date of
this prospectus, and does not address special tax rules applicable to certain types of investors, such as corporate, tax-exempt
and foreign investors. Investors should consult their tax advisers regarding other federal, state or local tax considerations that
may be applicable in their particular circumstances, as well as any proposed tax law changes.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">The following is a summary discussion of certain U.S. federal
income tax consequences that may be relevant to a shareholder of the Fund that acquires, holds and/or disposes of shares of the
Fund, and reflects provisions of the Code existing Treasury regulations, rulings published by the IRS, and other applicable authority,
as of the date of this prospectus. These authorities are subject to change by legislative or administrative action, possibly with
retroactive effect. The following discussion is only a summary of some of the important tax considerations generally applicable
to investments in the Fund and the discussion set forth herein does not constitute tax advice. For more detailed information regarding
tax considerations, see the SAI. There may be other tax considerations applicable to particular investors such as those holding
shares in a tax-advantaged account such as an IRA or 401(k)&nbsp;plan. In addition, income earned through an investment in the
Fund may be subject to state, local and foreign taxes.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">The Fund intends to elect to be treated and to qualify each
year for taxation as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. In order for the Fund to qualify as a RIC, it must meet an income test
each year and asset diversification tests each quarter. If the Fund so qualifies and satisfies certain distribution requirements,
the Fund (but not its shareholders) will not be subject to federal income tax to the extent it distributes its investment company
taxable income and net capital gains (the excess of net long-term capital gains over net short-term capital loss) in a timely manner
to its shareholders in the form of dividends or capital gain distributions. The Code imposes a 4% nondeductible excise tax on RICs,
such as the Fund, to the extent they do not meet certain distribution requirements by the end of each calendar year. The Fund anticipates
meeting these distribution requirements.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">The Fund intends to make distributions of investment company
taxable income after payment of the Fund’s operating expenses no less frequently than annually. Unless a shareholder is ineligible
to participate or elects otherwise, all distributions will be automatically reinvested in additional shares of the Fund pursuant
to the distribution reinvestment policy. For U.S. federal income tax purposes, all dividends are generally taxable whether a shareholder
takes them in cash or they are reinvested pursuant to the policy in additional shares of the Fund.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Distributions of the Fund’s investment company taxable
income (including short-term capital gains) will generally be treated as ordinary income to the extent of the Fund’s current
and accumulated earnings and profits. Distributions of the Fund’s net capital gains (“capital gain dividends”),
if any, are taxable to shareholders as capital gains, regardless of the length of time shares have been held by shareholders. Distributions,
if any, in excess of the Fund’s earnings and profits will first reduce the adjusted tax basis of a holder’s shares
and, after that basis has been reduced to zero, will constitute capital gains to the shareholder of the Fund (assuming the shares
are held as a capital asset). A corporation that owns Fund shares generally will not be entitled to the dividends received deduction
with respect to all of the dividends it receives from the Fund. Fund dividend payments that are attributable to qualifying dividends
received by the Fund from certain domestic corporations may be designated by the Fund as being eligible for the dividends received
deduction. There can be no assurance as to what portion of Fund dividend payments, if any, may be classified as qualifying dividends.
Dividends received from REITs and certain foreign corporations generally will not constitute qualified dividend income. The determination
of the character for U.S. federal income tax purposes of any distribution from the Fund (i.e. ordinary income dividends, capital
gains dividends, qualified dividends or return of capital distributions) will be made as of the end of the Fund’s taxable
year. Generally, no later than 60 days after the close of its taxable year, the Fund will provide shareholders with a written notice
designating the amount of any capital gain distributions and any other distributions.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">If you sell, exchange or otherwise dispose of any of your Shares
of the Fund (including (i) exchanging them for shares of another eligible Fund as described in “Exchange of Shares”
below or (ii) through a redemption) you will generally recognize a gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between your
tax basis in such Shares of the Fund and the amount you receive upon disposition of such Shares. If you hold your Shares as capital
assets, any such gain or loss will be long-term capital gain or loss if you have held (or are treated as having held) such Shares
for more than one year at the time of sale. All or a portion of any loss you realize on a taxable sale or exchange of your Shares
of a Fund will be disallowed if you acquire other Shares of the Fund (whether through the automatic reinvestment of dividends or
otherwise) within a 61-day period beginning 30 days before and ending 30 days after your sale or exchange of the Shares. In such
case, the basis of the Shares acquired will be adjusted to reflect the disallowed loss.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">In addition, any loss realized upon a taxable sale or exchange
of Fund Shares held (or deemed held) by you for six&nbsp;months or less will be treated as long-term, rather than short-term, to
the extent of any capital gain dividends received (or deemed received) by you with respect to those shares.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">The Fund’s continuous offering is expected to continue
in reliance on Rule 415 under the Securities Act of 1933 until the date the Fund has sold [<font style="font-size: 10pt">•</font>]
shares, or such shorter date as the Board may determine. No arrangement has been made to place funds received in an escrow, trust
or similar account. The Distributor is not required to sell any specific number or dollar amount of the Fund’s shares, but
will use its reasonable efforts to sell the shares. Shares of the Fund will not be listed on any national securities exchange and
the Distributor will not act as a market marker in Fund shares.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Hanzo or its affiliates, in Hanzo’s discretion and from
its own resources (which may include its legitimate profits from the management fee or the performance fee it receives from the
Fund), may pay compensation to brokers or dealers in connection with the sale and distribution of Fund shares. There is no limit
on the amount of compensation paid by the Adviser or its affiliates, subject to the limitations imposed by FINRA. In return for
such compensation, the Fund may receive certain marketing advantages including access to a broker’s or dealer’s registered
representatives, placement on a list of investment options offered by a broker or dealer, or the ability to assist in training
and educating the broker’s or dealer’s registered representatives. The compensation may differ among brokers or dealers
in amount or in the manner of calculation: payments of such compensation may be fixed dollar amounts, or based on the aggregate
value of outstanding shares held by shareholders introduced by the broker or dealer, or determined in some other manner. The receipt
of compensation by a selling broker or dealer may create potential conflicts of interest between an investor and its broker or
dealer who is recommending the Fund over other potential investments. The payment of compensation may also have the effect of increasing
the Fund’s assets under management, which would increase management fees payable to the Adviser.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0in">From time to time the Fund may pay broker-dealers
and other intermediaries’ account-based fees for services such as account maintenance. In addition, the Adviser and/or the
Distributor may, from time to time, make other cash payments to broker-dealers or other financial intermediaries in the form of
payment for travel expenses, including lodging, incurred in connection with trips taken by qualifying registered representatives
of those broker-dealers or other financial intermediaries and their families to places within or outside the United States; meeting
fees; entertainment; transaction processing and transmission charges; advertising or other promotional expenses; allocable portions,
based on shares of the Fund sold, of salaries and bonuses of registered representatives of an affiliated broker-dealer or other
financial intermediary that is a financial advisor; or other expenses as determined in the Adviser or the Distributor’s discretion,
as applicable. In certain cases these other payments could be significant to the broker-dealers or other financial intermediaries.
Any payments described above will not change the price paid by investors for the purchase of the shares of the Fund or the amount
that the Fund will receive as proceeds from such sales.</p>

the Fund has no current intention to do so, the Fund may borrow money from banks (including its custodian bank) or from other lenders
to the extent permitted under applicable law. The 1940 Act requires the Fund to maintain asset coverage of at least 300% for all
such borrowings. If at any time such asset coverage should fall below 300%, the Fund would be required to reduce its borrowings
within three days to the extent necessary to meet the requirements of the 1940 Act. The Fund will not make any borrowing that would
cause its outstanding borrowings to exceed one-third of the value of its total assets. To reduce its borrowings, the Fund might be required to sell securities
at a time when it would be disadvantageous to do so. In addition, because interest on money borrowed is a Fund expense that it
would not otherwise incur, the Fund may have less net investment income during periods when its borrowings are substantial. The
interest paid by the Fund on borrowings may be more or less than the yield on the securities purchased with borrowed funds, depending
on prevailing market conditions.</p>

for defensive purposes or otherwise, some or all of its assets in high quality fixed-income securities, money market instruments
and money market mutual funds, or hold cash or cash equivalents in such amounts as the Adviser deems appropriate under the circumstances.
In addition, the Fund may invest in these instruments pending allocation of its offering proceeds. Money market instruments are
high quality, short-term fixed-income obligations, which generally have remaining maturities of one year or less and may include
U.S. government securities, commercial paper, certificates of deposit and bankers acceptances issued by domestic branches of U.S.
banks that are members of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and repurchase agreements.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><b><i>Mortgage-Backed Securities. </i></b>The Fund may invest
in mortgage-backed securities. Common examples of mortgage backed securities include commercial mortgage-backed securities (“CMBS”)
and residential mortgage-backed securities (“RMBS”). Mortgage-backed securities differ from conventional fixed-income
securities because principal is paid back over the life of the security rather than at maturity.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">CMBS are a type of mortgage-backed security that is secured
by a single commercial mortgage loan or a pool of commercial real estate loans. Like all mortgage-backed securities, CMBS are subject
to all of the risks of the underlying mortgage loans. Because they are not standardized, CMBS can be difficult to value. Commercial
real estate loans are secured by multifamily or commercial property and are subject to risks of delinquency and foreclosure. The
ability of a borrower to repay a loan secured by an income-producing property typically is dependent primarily upon the successful
operation of such property rather than upon the existence of independent income or assets of the borrower. If the net operating
income of the property is reduced, the borrower’s ability to repay the loan may be impaired. Net operating income of an income-producing
property can be affected by, among other things: tenant mix, success of tenant businesses, property management decisions, property
location and condition, competition from comparable types of properties, changes in laws that increase operating expenses or limit
rents that may be charged, any need to address environmental contamination at the property, the occurrence of any uninsured casualty
at the property, changes in national, regional or local economic conditions and/or specific industry segments, declines in regional
or local real estate values, declines in regional or local rental or occupancy rates, increases in interest rates, real estate
tax rates and other operating expenses, and changes in governmental rules, regulations and fiscal policies, including environmental
legislation, natural disasters, terrorism, social unrest and civil disturbances.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">RMBS are a type of mortgage backed security that is backed by
mortgages on residential real estate. Credit-related risk on RMBS arises from losses due to delinquencies and defaults by the borrowers
in payments on the underlying mortgage loans and breaches by originators and servicers of their obligations under the underlying
documentation pursuant to which the RMBS are issued. The rate of delinquencies and defaults on residential mortgage loans and the
aggregate amount of the resulting losses will be affected by a number of factors, including general economic conditions, particularly
those in the area where the related mortgaged property is located, the level of the borrower’s equity in the mortgaged property
and the individual financial circumstances of the borrower. If a residential mortgage loan is in default, foreclosure on the related residential property may be a lengthy and difficult
process involving significant legal and other expenses. The net proceeds obtained by the holder on a residential mortgage loan
following the foreclosure on the related property may be less than the total amount that remains due on the loan. The prospect
of incurring a loss upon the foreclosure of the related property may lead the holder of the residential mortgage loan to restructure
the residential mortgage loan or otherwise delay the foreclosure process.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">The Fund may also invest in the residual or equity tranches
of CMBS (which may be called subordinate CMBS and interest-only CMBS). Subordinate CMBSs are paid interest only to the extent that
there are funds available to make payments. To the extent the collateral pool includes a large percentage of delinquent loans,
there is a risk that interest payment on subordinate CMBSs will not be fully paid. There are multiple tranches of CMBS, offering
investors various maturity and credit risk characteristics. Tranches are categorized as senior, mezzanine, and subordinated/equity,
according to their degree of risk. The most senior tranche of a CMBS has the greatest collateralization and pays the lowest interest
rate. If there are defaults or the collateral otherwise underperforms, scheduled payments to senior tranches take precedence over
those of mezzanine tranches, and scheduled payments to mezzanine tranches take precedence over those to subordinated/equity tranches.
Lower tranches represent lower degrees of credit quality and pay higher interest rates intended to compensate for the attendant
risks. The return on the lower tranches is especially sensitive to the rate of defaults in the collateral pool. The lowest tranche
(i.e. the “equity” or “residual” tranche) specifically receives the residual interest payments (i.e., money
that is left over after the higher tranches have been paid and expenses of the issuing entities have been paid) rather than a fixed
interest rate. Investments in subordinate CMBs will be subject to risks arising from delinquencies and foreclosures, thereby exposing
the Fund’s portfolio to potential losses. Subordinate securities of CMBSs are also subject to greater credit risk than those
CMBSs that are more highly rated. The Fund also may invest in interest-only multifamily CMBS issued by multifamily mortgage loan
securitizations. However, these interest-only multifamily CMBS typically only receive payments of interest to the extent that there
are funds available in the securitization to make the payment and may introduce increased risks since these securities have no
underlying principal cash flows.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><b><i>Preferred Stock. </i></b>The Fund may invest in preferred
stock. Preferred stocks are equity securities, but they have many characteristics of fixed income securities, such as a fixed dividend
payment rate and/or a liquidity preference over the issuer’s common shares. However, because preferred stocks are equity
securities, they may be more susceptible to risks traditionally associated with equity investments than the Fund’s holdings
of fixed income securities.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Preferred stocks owned by the Fund may include fixed rate preferred
stock, adjustable rate preferred stock, preferred stock that is convertible into other equity securities, or auction rate preferred
stock. Fixed rate preferred stocks have fixed dividend rates. They can be perpetual, with no mandatory redemption date, or issued
with a fixed mandatory redemption date. Certain issues of preferred stock are convertible into other equity securities. Perpetual
preferred stocks provide a fixed dividend throughout the life of the issue, with no mandatory retirement provisions, but may be
callable. Sinking fund preferred stocks provide for the redemption of a portion of the issue on a regularly scheduled basis with,
in most cases, the entire issue being retired at a future date. The value of fixed rate preferred stocks can be expected to vary
inversely with interest rates.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Adjustable rate preferred stocks have a variable dividend rate
which is determined periodically, typically quarterly, according to a formula based on a specified premium or discount to the yield
on particular U.S. Treasury securities, typically the highest base-rate yield of one of three U.S. Treasury securities: the 90-day
Treasury bill; the 10-year Treasury note; and either the 20-year or 30-year Treasury bond or other index. The premium or discount
to be added to or subtracted from this base-rate yield is fixed at the time of issuance and cannot be changed without the approval
of the holders of the adjustable rate preferred stock. Some adjustable rate preferred stocks have a maximum and a minimum rate
and in some cases are convertible into common stock.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Auction rate preferred stocks pay dividends that adjust based
on periodic auctions. Such preferred stocks are similar to short-term corporate money market instruments in that an auction rate
preferred stockholder has the opportunity to sell the preferred stock at par in an auction, normally conducted at least every 49
days, through which buyers set the dividend rate in a bidding process for the next period. The dividend rate set in the auction
depends on market conditions and the credit quality of the particular issuer. Typically, the auction rate preferred stock’s
dividend rate is limited to a specified maximum percentage of an external commercial paper index as of the auction date. Further,
the terms of the auction rate preferred stocks generally provide that they are redeemable by the issuer at certain times or under
certain conditions. In early 2008, auction rate preferred stocks became subject to numerous “failed” auctions, causing
securities previously thought to be liquid to become illiquid. It is not known when, if ever, these auction markets will begin
to function again. Special tax considerations may apply to the Fund’s investments in preferred stock.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><b><i>Repurchase Agreements.</i></b> The Fund may enter into
repurchase agreements without limitation. When participating in repurchase agreements, the Fund buys securities from a seller (e.g.,
a bank or brokerage firm) with the agreement that the seller will repurchase the securities at the agreed-upon price at a later
date. Repurchase agreements may also be viewed as loans made by the Fund that are collateralized by the securities subject to repurchase.
Such transactions afford an opportunity for the Fund to earn a return on available liquid assets at minimal market risk, although
the Fund may be subject to various delays and risks of loss if the counterparty is unable to meet its obligation to repurchase.
If the counterparty to a repurchase agreement defaults on its repurchase obligation pursuant to the repurchase agreement, the Fund
may lose money to the extent proceeds from the sale of collateral are less than the repurchase price. If the member bank or member
firm that is the party to the repurchase agreement petitions for bankruptcy or otherwise becomes subject to the Bankruptcy Code,
the law regarding the rights of the Fund is unsettled and the Fund’s realization upon the collateral may be delayed or limited.
The Adviser will evaluate the creditworthiness of the repurchase agreement counterparties with whom the Fund does business and
will monitor their creditworthiness during the period of any repurchase agreement.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><b><i>Short-Term Trading. </i></b>Short-term trading involves
the selling of securities held for a short time, ranging from several months to less than a day. The object of such short-term
trading is to increase the potential for capital appreciation and/or income of the Fund in order to take advantage of what the
Adviser believes are changes in market, industry or individual company conditions or outlook. Any such trading would increase the turnover
rate of the Fund and its transaction costs, and could result in higher taxes for shareholders if Fund shares are held in a taxable
account.</p>

During periods in which the Adviser determines that it is temporarily unable to follow the Fund’s investment strategy or
that it is impractical to do so or pending reinvestment of proceeds received in connection with the sale of a portfolio security
or the issuance of additional securities or borrowing money by the Fund, all or any portion of the Fund’s assets may be invested
in cash or cash equivalents. The Adviser’s determination that it is temporarily unable to follow the Fund’s investment
strategy or that it is impractical to do so will generally occur only in situations in which a market disruption event has occurred
and where trading in the securities selected through application of the Fund’s investment strategy is extremely limited or
absent. In such a case, the market price of the Fund’s shares may be adversely affected, and the Fund may not pursue or achieve
its investment objective.</p>

The Repurchase Offer Policy also provides that the repurchase pricing shall occur not later than the 14<sup>th</sup> day after
the Repurchase Request Deadline or the next business day if the 14<sup>th</sup> day is not a business day. The Fund’s Repurchase
Offer Policy is fundamental and cannot be changed without shareholder approval. The Fund may, for the purpose of paying for repurchased
shares, be required to liquidate portfolio holdings earlier than the Adviser would otherwise have liquidated these holdings. Such
liquidations may result in losses, and may increase the Fund’s portfolio turnover.</p>

The members of the Audit and Qualified Legal Compliance Committee (the “Audit Committee”) are [•], each of whom
is independent for purposes of the 1940 Act. [•] serves as Chairman of the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee is responsible
for approving the Fund’s independent accountants, reviewing with the Fund’s independent accountants the plans and results
of the audit engagement, approving professional services provided by the Fund’s independent accountants, reviewing the independence
of the Fund’s independent accountants and reviewing the adequacy of the Fund’s internal accounting controls. The Audit
Committee is charged with compliance with Rules 205.2(k) and 205.3(c) of Title 17 of the Code of Federal Regulations regarding
alternative reporting procedures for attorneys representing the Corporation who appear and practice before the SEC on behalf of
the Fund. The Audit Committee is also responsible for aiding the Board in fair value pricing debt and equity securities that are
not publicly traded or for which current market values are not readily available. The Board and Audit Committee may use the services
of one or more independent valuation firms to help them determine the fair
value of these securities. In addition, each member of the Audit Committee meets the current independence and experience requirements
of Rule 10A-3 under the Exchange Act. The Audit Committee is also responsible for reviewing and setting Independent Trustee compensation
from time to time when considered necessary or appropriate. As the Fund is newly organized, there have not been any meetings of
the Audit Committee held during the last fiscal year.</p>

<p style="font: bold 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Board Leadership Structure</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">The Fund is led by [•], who has served as the Chairman
of the Board since the Fund’s inception. Under certain 1940 Act governance guidelines that apply to the Fund, the Independent
Trustees will meet in executive session, at least quarterly. Under the Fund’s governing documents, the Chairman of the Board
is responsible for (a) presiding at board meetings, (b) calling special meetings on an as-needed basis, (c) execution and administration
of Fund policies including (i) setting the agendas for board meetings and (ii) providing information to board members in advance
of each board meeting and between board meetings. The Fund believes that the Chairman, and, as an entity, the full Board, provide
effective leadership that is in the best interests of the Fund and each shareholder.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">The Board periodically reviews its leadership structure, including
the role of the Chairman. The Board also completes an annual self-assessment during which it reviews its leadership and committee
structure and considers whether its structure remains appropriate in light of the Fund’s current operations. The Board believes
that its leadership structure, including the current percentage of the Board who are Independent Trustees is appropriate given
its specific characteristics. These characteristics include: (i) the extent to which the work of the Board is conducted through
the standing committees, each of whose meetings are chaired by an Independent Trustee; and (ii) the extent to which the Independent
Trustees meet as needed in the absence of members of management and any member of the Board who is considered an “interested
person” of the Fund.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: italic bold 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Board Oversight of Risk Management</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">The Board’s role is one of oversight, rather than active
management. This oversight extends to the Fund’s risk management processes. These processes are embedded in the responsibilities
of officers of, and service providers to, the Fund. For example, the Investment Adviser and other service providers to the Fund
are primarily responsible for the management of the Fund’s investment risks. The Board has not established a formal risk
oversight committee. However, much of the regular work of the Board and its standing committees addresses aspects of risk oversight.
For example, the Trustees seek to understand the key risks facing the Fund, including those involving conflicts of interest; how
management identifies and monitors these risks on an ongoing basis; how management develops and implements controls to mitigate
these risks; and how management tests the effectiveness of those controls.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">In the course of providing that oversight, the Board will receive
a wide range of reports on the Fund’s activities from the Adviser and other service providers, including reports regarding
the Fund’s investment portfolio, the compliance of the Fund with applicable laws, and the Fund’s financial accounting
and reporting. The Board will also meet periodically with the Fund’s Chief Compliance Officer to receive reports regarding
the compliance of the Fund with the federal securities laws and the Fund’s internal compliance policies and procedures and
meets with the Fund’s Chief Compliance Officer periodically, including at least annually, to review the Chief Compliance
Officer’s annual report. The Board’s Audit Committee will also meet regularly with the Chief Financial Officer and
Treasurer and the Fund’s independent public accounting firm to discuss, among other things, the internal control structure
of the Fund’s financial reporting function. The Board will also meet periodically with the portfolio managers of the Fund
to receive reports regarding the management of the Fund, including its investment risks.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">The Board recognizes that not all risks that may affect the
Fund can be identified, that it may not be practical or cost-effective to eliminate or mitigate certain risks, that it may be necessary
to bear certain risks (such as investment-related risks) to achieve the Fund’s goals, that reports received by the Trustees
with respect to risk management matters are typically summaries of the relevant information, and that the processes, procedures
and controls employed to address risks may be limited in their effectiveness. As a result of the foregoing and other factors, risk
management oversight by the Board and by the Audit Committee is subject to substantial limitations.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Specific decisions to purchase or sell securities for the Fund
are made by the portfolio manager who is an employee of the Adviser. The Adviser is authorized by the Trustees to allocate the
orders placed on behalf of the Fund to brokers or dealers who may, but need not, provide research or statistical material or other
services to the Fund or the Adviser for the Fund’s use. Such allocation is to be in such amounts and proportions as the Adviser
may determine.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">While such services are useful and important in supplementing
its own research and facilities, the Adviser believes the value of such services is not determinable and does not significantly
reduce its expenses. Any research or other benefits received by the Adviser from a broker-dealer, for transactions where the Fund

provide brokerage, research and other services to other accounts over which the Adviser exercises investment discretion. Some of
the services received as the result of Fund transactions may primarily benefit accounts other than the Fund, while services received
as the result of portfolio transactions effected on behalf of those other accounts may primarily benefit the Fund. While such services

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">The following discussion is general in nature and should not
be regarded as an exhaustive presentation of all possible tax ramifications. All shareholders should consult a qualified tax adviser
regarding their investment in the Fund.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">The Fund intends to elect to be treated and to qualify as a
RIC under Subchapter M of the Code, which requires compliance with certain requirements concerning the sources of its income, diversification
of its assets, and the amount and timing of its distributions to shareholders. Such qualification does not involve supervision
of management or investment practices or policies by any government agency or bureau. By so qualifying, the Fund should not be
subject to federal income or excise tax on its net investment income or net capital gain, which are distributed to shareholders
in accordance with the applicable timing requirements. Net investment income and net capital gain of the Fund will be computed
in accordance with Section 852 of the Code. Net investment income is made up of dividends and interest less expenses. Net capital
gain for a fiscal year is computed by taking into account any capital loss carryforward of the Fund.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">The Fund intends to distribute all of its net investment income,
any excess of net short-term capital gains over net long-term capital losses, and any excess of net long-term capital gains over
net short-term capital losses in accordance with the timing requirements imposed by the Code and therefore should not be required
to pay any federal income or excise taxes. Distributions of net investment income will be made quarterly and net capital gain will
be made after the end of each fiscal year, and no later than December 31 of each year. Both types of distributions will be in shares
of the Fund unless a shareholder elects to receive cash.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">To be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code, the Fund
must also (a) derive at least 90% of its gross income from dividends, interest, payments with respect to securities loans, net
income from certain publicly traded partnerships and gains from the sale or other disposition of securities or foreign currencies,
or other income (including, but not limited to, gains from options, futures or forward contracts) derived with respect to the business
of investing in such securities or currencies, and (b) diversify its holdings so that, at the end of each fiscal quarter, (i) at
least 50% of the market value of the Fund’s assets is represented by cash, U.S. government securities and securities of other
RICs, and other securities (for purposes of this calculation, generally limited in respect of any one issuer, to an amount not
greater than 5% of the market value of the Fund’s assets and 10% of the outstanding voting securities of such issuer) and
(ii) not more than 25% of the value of its assets is invested in the securities of (other than U.S. government securities or the
securities of other RICs) any one issuer, two or more issuers which the Fund controls and which are determined to be engaged in
the same or similar trades or businesses, or the securities of certain publicly traded partnerships.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">If the Fund fails to qualify as a RIC under Subchapter M in
any fiscal year, it will be treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes. As such, the Fund would be required to pay
income taxes on its net investment income and net realized capital gains, if any, at the applicable corporate income tax rate.
Shareholders of the Fund generally would not be liable for income tax on the Fund’s net investment income or net realized
capital gains in their individual capacities. Distributions to shareholders, whether from the Fund’s net investment income
or net realized capital gains, would be treated as taxable dividends to the extent of current or accumulated earnings and profits
of the Fund.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">The Fund is subject to a 4% nondeductible excise tax on certain
undistributed amounts of ordinary income and capital gain under a prescribed formula contained in Section 4982 of the Code. The
formula requires payment to shareholders during a calendar year of distributions representing at least 98% of the Fund’s
ordinary income for the calendar year and at least 98.2% of its capital gain net income (i.e., the excess of its capital gains
over capital losses) realized during the one-year period ending October 31 during such year plus 100% of any income that was neither
distributed nor taxed to the Fund during the preceding calendar year. Under ordinary circumstances, the Fund expects to time its
distributions so as to avoid liability for this tax.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">The following discussion of tax consequences is for the general
information of shareholders that are subject to tax. Shareholders that are IRAs or other qualified retirement plans are exempt
from income taxation under the Code.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Distributions of taxable net investment income and the excess

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Distributions of net capital gain (“capital gain dividends”)
generally are taxable to shareholders as long-term capital gain, regardless of the length of time the shares of the Fund have been
held by such shareholders.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">A redemption of Fund shares by a shareholder will result in
the recognition of taxable gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between the amount realized and the shareholder’s
tax basis in his or her Fund shares.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Such gain or loss is treated as a capital gain or loss if the
shares are held as capital assets. However, any loss realized upon the redemption of shares within six months from the date of
their purchase will be treated as a long-term capital loss to the extent of any amounts treated as capital gain dividends during
such six-month period. All or a portion of any loss realized upon the redemption of shares may be disallowed to the extent shares
are purchased (including shares acquired by means of reinvested dividends) within 30 days before or after such redemption.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Distributions of taxable net investment income and net capital
gain will be taxable as described above, whether received in additional cash or shares. Shareholders electing to receive distributions
in the form of additional shares will have a cost basis for federal income tax purposes in each share so received equal to the
net asset value of a share on the reinvestment date.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">All distributions of taxable net investment income and net capital
gain, whether received in shares or in cash, must be reported by each taxable shareholder on his or her federal income tax return.
Dividends or distributions declared in October, November or December as of a record date in such a month, if any, will be deemed
to have been received by shareholders on December 31, if paid during January of the following year. Redemptions of shares may result
in tax consequences (gain or loss) to the shareholder and are also subject to these reporting requirements. Investing in municipal
bonds and other tax-exempt securities is not a principal investment strategy of the Fund. Nonetheless, to the extent the Fund invests
in municipal bonds that are not exempt from the alternative minimum tax, some shareholders may be subject to the alternative minimum
tax. Under 2017 legislation commonly known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “TCJA”), corporations are no longer subject
to the alternative minimum tax for taxable years of the corporation beginning after December 31, 2017. Investors should consult
their tax advisers for more information.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Under the Code, the Fund will be required to report to shareholders
and to the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) all distributions of taxable income and capital gains as well as gross
proceeds from the redemption or exchange of Fund shares, except in the case of certain exempt shareholders. Under the backup withholding
provisions of Section 3406 of the Code, distributions of taxable net investment income and net capital gain and proceeds from the
redemption or exchange of the shares of a RIC may be subject to withholding of federal income tax in the case of non-exempt shareholders
who fail to furnish the investment company with their taxpayer identification numbers (“TIN”) and with required certifications
regarding their status under the federal income tax law, or if the Fund is notified by the IRS or a broker that withholding is
required due to an incorrect TIN or a previous failure to report taxable interest or dividends. If the withholding provisions are
applicable, any such distributions and proceeds, whether taken in cash or reinvested in additional shares, will be reduced by the
amounts required to be withheld.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">The TCJA provides a limitation on deductions of business interest.
Generally, the provision limits the deduction for net business interest expenses to 30% of a taxpayer’s adjusted taxable
income. The deduction for interest expenses is not limited to the extent of any business interest income, which is interest income
attributable to a trade or business and not investment income. It is unclear whether RICs should be subject to this rule because,
generally, RICs are not viewed as being engaged in a trade or business for federal income tax purposes. If it is determined that
the provision applies to RICs, then it would generally impact closed-end funds or business development companies that use leverage
(e.g., borrow money, issue debt securities, etc.).</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Gain recognized on the disposition of a debt obligation purchased
by a fund at a market discount (generally, at a price less than its principal amount) will be treated as ordinary income to the
extent of the portion of the market discount that accrued during the period of time the fund held the debt obligation, unless the
fund made a current inclusion election to accrue market discount into income as it accrues. (The TCJA requires certain taxpayers
to recognize items of gross income for tax purposes in the year in which the taxpayer recognizes the income for financial accounting
purposes. For financial accounting purposes, market discount must be accrued currently on a constant yield to maturity basis, regardless
of whether a current inclusion election is made. While the exact scope of this provision is not known at this time, it could cause
a fund to recognize income earlier for tax purposes than would otherwise have been the case prior to the enactment of the TCJA.)</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">If a fund purchases a debt obligation (such as a zero coupon
security or pay-in-kind security) that was originally issued at a discount, the fund generally is required to include in gross
income each year the portion of the original issue discount that accrues during such year. Therefore, a fund’s investment
in such securities may cause the fund to recognize income and make distributions to shareholders before it receives any cash payments
on the securities. To generate cash to satisfy those distribution requirements, a fund may have to sell portfolio securities that
it otherwise might have continued to hold or to use cash flows from other sources such as the sale of fund shares.</p>

The Registrant hereby undertakes that it will apply the indemnification provisions of the Declaration of Trust in a manner consistent
with Release 40-11330 of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) under the Investment Company Act of 1940,
as amended (the “1940 Act”), so long as the interpretation therein of Sections 17(h) and 17(i) of the 1940 Act remains
in effect. The Registrant will maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was an independent trustee, officer, employee,
or agent of the Registrant against certain liability asserted against and incurred by, or arising out of, his or her position.
However, in no event will the Registrant pay that portion of the premium, if any, for insurance to indemnify any such person for
any act for which the Registrant itself is not permitted to indemnify.</p>

arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), may be permitted to directors, officers
and controlling persons of the registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the registrant has been advised that
in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities
Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment
by the registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the registrant in the successful
defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities
being registered, the registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent,
submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed
in the Securities Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue</p>
